# Hurricane_Sandy
Analysis I did for chapter on Sandy in "Atmospheric Hazards" (2016)

This analysis was the first major R coding project in which I participated, and as such some of the techniques used are not always the most efficient available. The package dplyr can significantly simplify some of the code in this repository.
